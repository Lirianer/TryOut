To-Do list:
1) Upper Assignment:
	
	UpperKEES Assignment:
	in each cell you store a value between 0 and 1000, 0 is default
    in the gameloop every time you calculate the average of cell and its 8 neighbors (edge counts for 0)
    then display the values during rendering (can be in numbers, but also in colors if you prefer that)
    then put 1000 in one of the cells and run the program.

2) Algorithm for a Wall Cell to detect Neighbor Wall Cells and join with them. (Can that be called and algorithm)

3) Try the Dijkstra's algorithm with something (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%E2%80%99s_Algorithm)
